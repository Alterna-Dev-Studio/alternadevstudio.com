2. Complete the global layout with proper header and footer
3. Create the projects listing and detail pages
4. Implement the blog listing and individual post pages
5. Build the Live Product Development page with streaming integrations
6. Create the contact page with form

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

- **Static Site Generator**: 11ty was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility
- **Headless CMS**: Directus was selected for its open-source nature and powerful API
- **Package Manager**: pnpm was chosen for its speed and disk efficiency
- **Templating Engine**: Nunjucks was selected for its powerful features and compatibility with 11ty

### Ongoing Considerations

- **CSS Approach**: Still deciding between Tailwind and custom CSS
- **Content Rendering**: Evaluating options for rendering Markdown or rich text from Directus
- **Streaming Integration**: Considering approaches for Twitch and YouTube integration
- **Form Handling**: Evaluating options for handling form submissions

## Known Issues

1. **Basic Layout**: The current layout is minimal and needs styling
2. **Missing Pages**: Several key pages are not yet implemented
3. **No Responsive Design**: The site is not yet responsive
4. **No Form Handling**: The contact form is not yet implemented
5. **No Streaming Integration**: Twitch and YouTube integrations are not yet implemented
